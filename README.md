# Dicom, Nii(nifti) Viewer

![N|Solid](http://ashtiani.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/dicom-viewer.jpg)
version : 0.0.1
A simple viewer for Dicom files and Nifti medical images. This is the first version, so there are many things that can be improved. I provided a sample nii.gz and a series of dicom files. Feel free to use yours. The medical images provided are the property of University of California, San Diego. Please use them for educational purposes. I would like to thank [Dr.Francisco Contijoch](http://cvil.ucsd.edu/members/francisco-contijoch/), who helped me a lot to understand the medical images structure to make this project work.

Please report bugs and inquiries to:
